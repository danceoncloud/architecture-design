---

The first component of your data architecture should be chosen based on how the data will be used. This choice fundamentally shapes the tools, patterns, and governance needed across the entire data lifecycle. The solution for data-at-rest serves as the critical starting point, as it can be selected based on final data consumption requirements, allowing the appropriate data ingestion pipeline to flow naturally from this decision.

## OLTP (Online Transactional Processing)
- **Characteristics**: High volume of small, atomic operations requiring immediate consistency
- **Examples**: Order processing, banking transactions, inventory management
- **Typical needs**: ACID properties, low latency for writes, high consistency
- **Architecture implications**: RDBMS, PC/EC systems
- **Solutions**: PostgreSQL, Google Spanner, AWS Aurora, YugabyteDB

## OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)
- **Characteristics**: Complex queries on large datasets, often historical
- **Examples**: Business intelligence, reporting, trend analysis
- **Typical needs**: High read throughput, column-oriented storage, aggregation capabilities
- **Architecture implications**: Data warehouses, eventual consistency often acceptable
- **Solutions**: Snowflake, AWS Redshift, Databricks SQL, ClickHouse 

## AI/ML Workloads
- **Characteristics**: Large-scale data processing, feature extraction, model training, real-time or batch inference
- **Examples**: Predictive analytics, recommendation systems, NLP, computer vision
- **Typical needs**: High throughput for data ingestion, scalable storage, distributed computing, GPU/TPU acceleration
- **Architecture implications**: Data lakes for raw data, data warehouses for feature stores, scalable compute clusters
- **Solutions**: AWS Redshift,  Databricks Data Platform

## Content Delivery
- **Characteristics**: Serving static or semi-static content to users
- **Examples**: Media streaming, website content, product images
- **Typical needs**: High availability, edge caching, geographic distribution
- **Architecture implications**: object storage, eventually consistent systems
- **Solutions**: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage

## User State Management
- **Characteristics**: Managing user sessions, preferences, profiles
- **Examples**: Shopping carts, personalization features, user settings
- **Typical needs**: Low latency reads/writes, high availability
- **Architecture implications**: In-memory data stores, AP/EL systems
- **Solutions**: MongoDB, Amazon DynamoDB, Firebase Firestore, Couchbase (for flexible user profiles)
