## What
**LWW** is a conflict resolution strategy used in distributed systems to determine which update to a piece of data should be considered authoritative when concurrent or conflicting writes occur.

## How does LWW Work
**Basic Principle**:
- The most recent write (based on a timestamp or sequence number) "wins" and overwrites previous values.
- Timestamps can be provided by clients or generated by the system.

**Implementation**:
- Each write operation is tagged with a timestamp.
- During synchronization or read operations, the system compares timestamps and retains the value with the latest timestamp.

## Why Retain during Synchronization or Read
LWW is most useful with multi-leader or leaderless system where strong consistency is traded to guarantee 
- high availability 
- high throughput 
- less latency 
- high efficiency (batch updates over each write update).
## Challenges
**Clock Synchronization**
- physical clocks across nodes may drift, leading to incorrect conflict resolution.
**Data Loss**
- If a client with a skewed clock writes stale data with a future timestamp, valid updates may be overwritten.
**No Merge Semantics**
- LWW discards older writes, even if they contain valuable complementary data.

## When to Use LWW
- Data is time-sensitive (e.g., IoT sensor readings).
- Simplicity and performance are prioritized over complex conflict resolution.

## When to Avoid LWW
- All concurrent updates must be preserved.
- Clock accuracy cannot be guaranteed.
