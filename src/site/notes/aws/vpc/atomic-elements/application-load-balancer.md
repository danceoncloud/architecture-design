![Application Load Balancer.png](/img/user/aws/vpc/png/atomic-elements/Application%20Load%20Balancer.png)
## What
- routing **HTTP and HTTPS** traffic to multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, based on advanced routing rules.

>[!info] Key Components
   >**Load Balancer**: single point of contact for clients
   > **Target Group**:  routes requests to one or more registered targets  
   > **Listener**: checks for connection requests from clients using the port and protocol and determines how to route requests to registered targets. 

## When
- ALB is used when you need advanced routing capabilities like **host-based**, **path-based**, or **query string routing**, and need to manage traffic for HTTP/HTTPS applications. 
- It is ideal for microservices, containerized applications, and serverless architectures

## Where
- ALB is deployed in **AWS regions** within **VPCs**, routing traffic to resources in private or public subnets across multiple availability zones.

## Why
- To achieve **high availability**, **fault tolerance**, **scalability**, and **flexible routing** in web applications.
