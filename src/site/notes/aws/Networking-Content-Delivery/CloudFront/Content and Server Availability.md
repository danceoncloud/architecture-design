> [!info] Content Availability Facilities:
>**Edge Locations (Points-of-Presence)**: These cache content close to users globally, reducing latency and improving availability even if the origin server experiences issues \
>**Regional Edge Caches**: The secondary cache layer with larger storage capacity that sits between edge locations and origins \
>**Origin Shield**: The last cache layer directly in front of the origin, reducing load on the origin server 

- Edge Locations and Regional Edge caches are managed by AWS, transparent for content owner and content requesters.
- Origin Shield can be enabled by creator of distribution and the closest region to Origin server should be chosen.


>[!important] Content Availability Configuration:
>**Cache Policy**: Control **what** is cached and **how long** it stays cached
>>TTL Settings: **Min TTL, Max TTL, Default TTL** \
>>Cache Key Composition: **Headers** in cache key, **Query strings**, **Cookies** 
>
>**Origin Query Policy**: Control what informations is **forward to** Origin when CloudFront needs to fetch content 
>>Headers Forwarded \
>>Query Strings Forwarded \
>>Cookies Forwarded
>
>**Origin Response Headers**: influence caching
>>Overides: `Cache-Control: max-age=3600` from the origin takes precedence over the Cache Policyâ€™s TTL.
>>Revalidation: CloudFront sends `If-Modified-Since` requests if the cached object is stale.

### How does TTL work with Origin Response Header to control cache duration
| Origin Header | Min TTL | Default TTL | Max TTL | Result       | Explanation                               |
| ------------- | ------- | ----------- | ------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| No header     | 60      | 1800        | 3600    | 1800 seconds | Default TTL used when no origin headers   |
| max-age=300   | 60      | 1800        | 3600    | 300 seconds  | Origin's value used (between Min and Max) |
| max-age=30    | 60      | 1800        | 3600    | 60 seconds   | Min TTL overrides shorter origin value    |
| max-age=7200  | 60      | 1800        | 3600    | 3600 seconds | Max TTL caps longer origin value          |


> [!example] Origin Server Availability
> **Origin failover**: Configure origin groups with a primary and secondary origin; if the primary fails, CloudFront automatically routes requests to the secondary \
> **Origin Group**: Up to 25 origins per distribution allows for redundancy and load balancing \
> **Health checks**: CloudFront can be configured to check origin health and route accordingly \
> **AWS Shield/WAF integration**: Protects origins from DDoS attacks and malicious traffic \
> **Elastic Load Balancing**: When using ELB as an origin, it distributes traffic across multiple instances
