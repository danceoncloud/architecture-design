## What
Route 53 provides services to register domain name or transfer domain name from other registrar or between AWS accounts.


>[!WARNING] **Domain Lock Status**
> By default, Route 53 enables a **registrar lock** to prevent unauthorized transfers. Keep this enabled unless transferring.
### **Transfer-Specific Considerations**
- **Authorization Code (EPP Code)**: Required for transferring domains between accounts or registrars. AWS automatically generates and manages this, but confirm itâ€™s accessible if needed.
- **AWS Account Ownership**: The domain is tied to the AWS account that registered it. To transfer it to another AWS account:
    - You must **initiate the transfer** from the **source account**.
    - The destination account must accept the transfer.    
- **60-Day Transfer Lock**: AWS imposes a 60-day lock after registration or ownership changes to prevent fraud.
